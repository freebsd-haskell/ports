Idris is a general purpose language with full dependent types.  It is
compiled, with eager evaluation.  Dependent types allow types to be
predicated on values, meaning that some aspects of a program's behaviour
can be specified precisely in the type.  The language is closely related
to Epigram and Agda.

Features include:

  * Full dependent types with dependent pattern matching.
  * where clauses, with rule, simple case expressions, pattern matching let
    and lambda bindings.
  * Type classes, monad comprehensions.
  * do notation, idiom brackets, syntactic conveniences for lists, tuples,
    dependent pairs.
  * Totality checking.
  * Coinductive types.
  * Indentation significant syntax, extensible syntax.
  * Tactic-based theorem proving (influenced by Coq).
  * Cumulative universes.
  * Simple Foreign Function interface (to C).
  * Hugs style interactive environment.
