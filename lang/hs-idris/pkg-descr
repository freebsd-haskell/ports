Idris is a general purpose language with full dependent types. It is
compiled, with eager evaluation. Dependent types allow types to be predicated
on values, meaning that some aspects of a program's behaviour can be
specified precisely in the type. The language is closely related to Epigram
and Agda. There is a tutorial at <http://www.idris-lang.org/documentation>.
Features include: * Full dependent types with dependent pattern matching
* where clauses, with rule, simple case expressions, pattern matching let
and lambda bindings * Type classes, monad comprehensions * do notation,
idiom brackets, syntactic conveniences for lists, tuples, dependent pairs
* Totality checking * Coinductive types * Indentation significant syntax,
extensible syntax * Tactic based theorem proving (influenced by Coq) *
Cumulative universes * Simple foreign function interface (to C) * Hugs
style interactive environment
