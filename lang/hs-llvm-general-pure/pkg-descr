llvm-general-pure is a set of pure Haskell types and functions for
interacting with LLVM <http://llvm.org/>. It includes an ADT to represent
LLVM IR (<http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html>). The llvm-general package
builds on this one with FFI bindings to LLVM, but llvm-general-pure does
not require LLVM to be available. For haddock, see
<http://bscarlet.github.io/llvm-general/3.3.8.0/doc/html/llvm-general-pure/index.html>.
