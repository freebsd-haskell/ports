Data.Scientific provides a space efficient and arbitrary precision
scientific number type.

Scientific numbers are represented using scientific notation.  It uses
a coefficient c :: Integer and a base-10 exponent e :: Int (do note
that since we're using an Int to represent the exponent these numbers
aren't truly arbitrary precision). A scientific number corresponds to
the Fractional number: fromInteger c * 10 ^^ e.
