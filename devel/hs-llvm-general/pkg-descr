llvm-general is a set of Haskell bindings for LLVM <http://llvm.org/>.
Unlike other current Haskell bindings, it uses an ADT to represent LLVM
IR (<http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html>), and so offers two advantages:
it handles almost all of the stateful complexities of using the LLVM API
to build IR; and it supports moving IR not only from Haskell into LLVM
C++ objects, but the other direction - from LLVM C++ into Haskell. For
haddock, see <http://bscarlet.github.io/llvm-general/3.3.8.2/doc/html/llvm-general/index.html>.
