Free monads are useful for many tree-like structures and domain specific
languages. A 'Monad' @n@ is a free 'Monad' for @f@ if every 'Monad'
homomorphism from @n@ to another monad @m@ is equivalent to a natural
transformation from @f@ to @m@. Cofree comonads provide convenient ways
to talk about branching streams and rose-trees, and can be used to annotate
syntax trees. A 'Comonad' @v@ is a cofree 'Comonad' for @f@ if every
'Comonad' homomorphism another comonad @w@ to @v@ is equivalent to a
natural transformation from @w@ to @f@.
