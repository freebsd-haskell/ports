Buildwrapper is an alternative to scion. It provides services to configure,
build and give information on source files to help IDEs manage Haskell
projects. You can use buildwrapper to build project and retrieve errors,
get outline for each module source, get the type of something inside a
source file, get lexer tokens, etc. Buildwrapper is used in the EclipseFP
project (Eclipse plugins for Haskell development)
