Express properties about Haskell programs and automatically prove them
using SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers. Automatically generate
C programs from Haskell functions. The SBV library adds support for symbolic
bit vectors and other symbolic types, allowing formal models of Haskell
programs to be created.
